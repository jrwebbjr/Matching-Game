Matching game - basic memory game
4 x 4 grid = 8 squares or cards...

modal - pop up asks for name, this will be used in messages throughout the game.

at onload, game refreshes random order of "cards" or images. 

first player selects first card and then I want a timer to start maybe 10 seconds to select a second card.
if player doesn't select second card within timer than first card flips back over and player 2 turn begins.

if player selects 2nd card within the time allotment then the match function will check the cards to see if they match if they do, those cards will need to dissapear off the grid and the player in turn will get a point under matches. 
if they don't match a timer will begin on the second card picked and reset after 3 seconds. Then change to the other players turn.
